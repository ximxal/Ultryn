# Ultryn

Ultryn is a robotics control project developed for the **MakeX Robotics Competition**.  
The latest code update was released on **August 31, 2025**.  

## Features
- Supports both **Python code** and **Block-based code**.  
- Some block functions are simplified or replaced with alternative logic.  
- Uses **new theoretical calculations** (developed by `aut`).  
- Red defense system (`กันโซโวแดง`).  
- Overheating prevention system (currently disabled).  

## Source Code
- Main Python implementation: [aespa.py](https://github.com/ximxal/Ultryn/blob/main/aespa.py)  
- Additional image reference (after line 110): [View here](https://ibb.co/hRvkBYfv)  

## Access to Full Code
The full project source code is available for **9,999,999 Robux**.  
If you are interested, please **contact via the contact information on GitHub**.  

## Notes
- Block-based coding is supported but may lack some advanced functions.  
- Functions can be swapped or restructured depending on your competition needs.
